# RepoDive: Navigate Your Codebase with AI-Powered Precision

**RepoDive** is an innovative codebase analysis platform designed to transform how developers understand complex and intricate software repositories. Forget endless `grep` commands and manual tracing ‚Äì RepoDive provides interactive, multi-layered abstractions, logic & data flow visualizations, and AI-driven insights to make even the most sophisticated systems intuitively navigable.

---

## üöÄ What is RepoDive?

In today's fast-paced development world, understanding a new or inherited codebase is a significant bottleneck. RepoDive tackles this challenge head-on by offering a holistic, deep-dive perspective into your repository. Whether you're dealing with large-scale systems like FastAPI, Redis, Nginx, or Postgres, or your personal frontend-backend stack (e.g., React JS frontend with Golang backend), RepoDive unearths the hidden structures and dynamic flows.

Our goal is to **significantly reduce the time and effort required for code comprehension**, enabling developers, new team members, and architects to quickly grasp complex systems and contribute effectively.

## ‚ú® Key Features

RepoDive provides an unparalleled level of code insight through its unique multi-layered approach and intelligent capabilities:

*   **Multi-Layered Abstraction:** Explore your codebase from a high-level ecosystem view down to individual code symbols.
*   **AI-Powered Architecture Discovery:** Our integrated AI Agent intelligently analyzes your codebase to automatically determine and visualize system architecture and component boundaries.
*   **Interactive Flow Visualizations:** Understand complex logic and data flows with dynamically generated sequence diagrams and component interaction graphs.
*   **Semantic Code Search:** Leverage TiDB as a vector database for intelligent, meaning-based code search, finding relevant code snippets even if you don't know the exact keywords.
*   **Code Symbol Graph:** Dive into the most granular level with a comprehensive graph of all code symbols (methods, classes, functions, variables) and their intricate relationships.
*   **Pluggable Language Support:** Designed for easy expansion to support new programming languages and frameworks.
*   **Contextual Feature Integration:** Ability to integrate non-code context like GitHub Pull Requests or Jira tickets directly into the codebase graph for richer understanding.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

RepoDive is built on a scalable, modular, and event-driven microservices architecture. This design ensures high performance, extensibility, and resilience for analyzing codebases of any size.

**Key Components:**

*   **Analysis Coordinator:** Initiates analysis requests, detects languages, and orchestrates the process by archiving source code to the `ObjectStore` and publishing messages to the `MessageBroker`.
*   **Pluggable Analyzer Workers:** Dedicated microservices (e.g., `JavaAnalyzer`, `PythonAnalyzer`) that are experts in analyzing a single programming language. They consume analysis requests from the `MessageBroker`, download source code from the `ObjectStore`, perform static analysis, and publish canonical graph fragments back to the `MessageBroker`. The base will be using `cased/kit`, This are looking for expert contributor to help out in this for different languages.
*   **Pluggable Feature Ingesters:** Services (e.g., `GitHubIngester`) that pull in external, non-code context (like PRs, commits, Jira tickets) and convert them into graph fragments, enriching the codebase graph.
*   **Data Ingestion Service:** The sole writer to our persistent databases. It consumes all graph fragments from the `MessageBroker` and efficiently populates Neo4j and TiDB.
*   **Neo4j Graph Database:** Stores the intricate code symbol graph, representing relationships like function calls, class inheritance, and variable usage.
*   **TiDB Vector Database:** Stores vector embeddings of code snippets, enabling advanced semantic search and similarity matching, powered by state-of-the-art code-aware AI models (e.g., CodeBERT).
*   **AI Agent:** The intelligent "brain" that queries the graph and vector databases, performs architectural pattern recognition, generates logic flows, and enables natural language search.
*   **Unified Query Service:** Provides a consistent API layer for the `AI Agent` and `Frontend` to retrieve data from Neo4j and TiDB.
*   **Object Storage (S3/MinIO):** Acts as a highly scalable, temporary storage for source code archives, facilitating decoupled data sharing between services.
*   **Message Broker (RabbitMQ/Kafka):** Enables asynchronous communication between services, ensuring resilience, independent scaling, and easy extensibility.
*   **Frontend (React SPA):** The interactive user interface for exploring the analyzed codebases, built with React and advanced visualization libraries.
